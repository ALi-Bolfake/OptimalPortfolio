# 1-Risk Parity method


The Risk Parity method is an investment strategy that aims to create an optimal portfolio by allocating assets based on their risk contributions rather than their market value. The goal is to balance the risk across different asset classes to achieve a more stable and diversified portfolio.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Risk Parity method works:

1. Asset Selection: Identify a set of asset classes to include in your portfolio. This can include stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and other investment options.

2. Risk Measurement: Calculate the risk of each asset class using a common risk metric such as volatility or standard deviation. These measures quantify the historical price fluctuations of each asset class.

3. Weight Calculation: Determine the weight or allocation of each asset class in your portfolio. The Risk Parity method assigns weights based on the risk contribution of each asset class rather than their market value. The higher the risk contribution, the lower the weight assigned.

4. Risk Contribution Calculation: Calculate the risk contribution of each asset class to the overall portfolio. This can be done by multiplying the weight of each asset class by its risk measure.

5. Rebalance: Periodically reassess the risk contributions and adjust the portfolio weights accordingly. As asset prices and volatilities change over time, the portfolio may deviate from the desired risk allocation. Rebalancing ensures that the portfolio maintains the intended risk parity.

6. Diversification Benefits: The Risk Parity method aims to achieve diversification benefits by allocating more weight to asset classes with lower correlations. By balancing the risk contributions, the portfolio becomes less dependent on any single asset class or market factor.

It's worth noting that implementing the Risk Parity method requires access to accurate risk measures and historical data for the selected asset classes. Additionally, there are variations and enhancements to the basic Risk Parity approach, such as incorporating expected returns or adjusting for leverage constraints, which can be explored based on specific investment goals and constraints.

As with any investment strategy, it's important to carefully consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.

# 2-Mean-Equal Weighting method


The Mean-Equal Weighting method is a simple approach to constructing an optimal portfolio that assigns equal weights to all assets in the portfolio. It is a form of naive diversification, where each asset receives the same allocation regardless of its risk or return characteristics.

Here's how the Mean-Equal Weighting method works:

Asset Selection: Identify a set of assets that you want to include in your portfolio. These assets could be stocks, bonds, or any other investment instruments.

Calculate Mean Returns: Calculate the average historical returns for each asset in your selected set. This can be done by taking the average of the past returns over a specific time period, such as one year.

Assign Equal Weights: Assign equal weights to each asset in the portfolio. For example, if you have 10 assets in your portfolio, each asset would receive a weight of 1/10 or 10%.

Portfolio Construction: Multiply the weight of each asset by its mean return to determine the contribution of each asset to the overall portfolio return. Sum up the contributions of all assets to calculate the expected portfolio return.

Portfolio Evaluation: Assess the risk and return characteristics of the portfolio. You can calculate metrics such as the portfolio standard deviation or Sharpe ratio to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance.

It's important to note that the Mean-Equal Weighting method does not take into account the specific risk and return characteristics of each asset. It assumes that all assets have equal potential and ignores any potential benefits of diversification. As a result, this method may not necessarily lead to an optimal portfolio in terms of risk-adjusted returns.

While the Mean-Equal Weighting method is simple and easy to implement, more sophisticated portfolio construction techniques, such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) or the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), consider the risk and return profiles of individual assets and aim to maximize portfolio efficiency. These approaches take into account factors such as correlation, covariance, and expected returns to construct portfolios that offer better risk-adjusted performance.

Therefore, it's advisable to consider more advanced portfolio optimization techniques if you're looking to construct an optimal portfolio that considers the risk and return characteristics of individual assets.
